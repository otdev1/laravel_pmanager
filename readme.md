The functionality of this website ( http://laravelpmanager.otwebdevelopment.net ) mimics that of an online business directory and implements the conventional CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on three database entities namely Companies, Roles and Users. Among these entities, various types of relationships such as one to many and many to one exist.

</br>

On this site users can:

-	view, create, edit, or delete a single company profile

-	view a list of all company profiles or those belonging to a specific user

-	search for a specific company

-	view roles and the users that are assigned to a specific role

-	register as a new user

-	log in with registration credentials or as a guest admin

-	view or edit a user’s profile

-	search for a specific user

Some other noteworthy details are that the search functionality was implemented using Typeahead.js and the Bloodhound suggestion engine. The front-end was 
built using the Blade template engine and user registration and log-in is powered by Laravel’s built in authentication component. This website is also mobile device friendly.

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
